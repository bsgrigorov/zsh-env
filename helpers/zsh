Conditional Operators
In the examples above, we implemented conditional operators such as -eq (equal to) and -gt (greater than). ZSH supports other conditional operators such as:

a -eq b – True if a is numerically equal to b
a -gt b – True if a is numerically greater than b
a -lt b – True if a is numerically less than b
a -ne b – True is a is not numerically equal to b
a -le b – True if a is numerically less than or equal to b
a -ge b – True if a is numerically greater than or equal to b
a != b – True if the string a is not equal to string b
a = b – True if string a is equal to string b
-z STRING – True if the length of the string is zero
-n STRING – True if the length of the string is non-zero
-a FILE – True if the file exists
-h FILE – True if the file exists and is a symbolic link
-f FILE – True if the file exists and is a regular file (not a directory or special file)
-d FILE – True if the file exists and is a directory
-e FILE – True if the file exists regardless of the type
-r FILE – True if the file exists and is readable by the current process
-w FILE – True if the file exists and is writeable by the current process
-x FILE – True if the file exists and is executable by the current process
-g FILE – True if file exists and has setgid bit set
-s FILE – True if file exists and size is greater than zero
-u – True if file exists and has setuid bit set
-o FILE – True if file exists and is owned by the current ID
! EXP – True if the expression is false
a && b – True if both a and b are true
a || b – True if either a or b is true
